Sprint #1 Report: Ride Share App
Team #NoLife, 10/16/15                                                                                                                                                         
* Actions to stop doing: We should stop going back and forth on what platform to use for our app, because it is delaying our progress a lot. In addition, we should stop ignoring when team members have an important thing to say, because it has led to us overlooking important problems. We should also not interrupt other team members when they are talking so that the person can give their opinion which will lead to our meetings going smoother. 
                                                                                                         
* Actions to start doing: We should start communicating more clearly, concisely and consistently, so that everyone can gain a better understanding of what we are doing. We should also start using the agreed-upon hand signal (“Live Well and Prosper” from Star Trek) to signal when a group member has an important point to make or objection to raise. It’s only logical. We should do a better job of including everyone in emails pertaining to the group, so that everyone can know what is going on and better contribute to the team. 
                                                                                                 
* Actions to keep doing: We should keep thinking critically and asking each other questions, as this leads to us understanding things better. We should keep showing up to as many meetings as possible on time, because that makes our meetings significantly more effective and time efficient. 
                                                        
* Work completed/not completed: We were able to complete two of our user stories for this sprint. The first was to be able to post information about ride offers such as time, origin, destination, being a driver or rider to the database. This was broken down into two subtasks in which we had to create a user interface and a database. The other user story we completed was being able to contact other users about ride offers. The subtask for this was to have a server to host the database. There were two user stories we didn’t complete. The first was for the user to display when they needed to get to their destination so that no student would be late for class. This directly connected with drivers knowing when to pick up their riders so everyone stays happy. The other uncompleted user story was to be able to search by destination or origin so that all users can reach their destination happily.
                                                                                                         
* Work completion rate: The total number of ideal hours that were completed this sprint were 26 out of a total of 42 estimated. There were a total of 17 days in the prior sprint. All of one user story’s subtasks were completed on Oct. 5 and another user story was completed on Oct. 16. A user story should have been completed at a rate of slightly greater than one per 4 days this would have enabled us to complete all of our user stories for this sprint. The ideal work hours per day should have been about 2.47 hours per day.
